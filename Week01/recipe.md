## Description
Mul Naengmyeon is a Korean cold noodle dish made with thin, chewy buckwheat noodles served in a refreshing, icy broth. It's a perfect dish for a hot summer day, offering a delightful combination of savory, tangy, and slightly sweet flavors. The dish is typically garnished with sliced beef, pickled radish, cucumber, and a hard-boiled egg, adding a variety of textures and tastes to each bite.

## Ingredients
* 10 ounces (280 grams) dried naengmyeon noodles
* 2 packets of liquid or powdered concentrated broth that comes with the package of naengmyeon noodles
* 2 packets of mustard oil that comes with the package of naengmyeon noodles
* ½ English cucumber, cut into thin strips
* 1 Korean pear (or 2 bosc pears)
* ½ teaspoon kosher salt
* 1½ teaspoon sugar
* 1 tablespoon white or apple cider vinegar
* 1 hard-boiled egg, cut in halves
* 2 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds, ground
* ice cubes

## Instructions (Serves 2)
### 1. Make Broth
1. Open the packets of the concentrated broth and put them into a bowl. Mix with 4 cups of water.
2. Keep in the freezer for 4 to 5 hours so it gets slushy. 
3. If you can’t make the broth in advance, make the broth with only 2 cups of water and add 2½ cups of ice cubes. Keep it in the fridge while you prepare everything else, and take it out just when you’re ready to serve.

### 2. Prepare cucumber and pear garnishes
1. Make quick pickled cucumbers by combining the sliced cucumber, kosher salt, ½ teaspoon sugar, and vinegar in a bowl. Mix it well and set aside.
2. Make sugar water by mixing 1 cup of water and 1 teaspoon sugar.
3. Peel the pear and slice into halves. Slice one half into thin strips and soak them in the sugar water to keep them from going brown.
4. Grate the other half of the pear and squeeze out the juice using a cotton cloth or cheesecloth. You should get about ½ cup of pear juice. If you use small bosc pears, use one for garnish and the other for pear juice.
5. Take the bowl of broth out of the freezer. Squeeze some cucumber brine into the broth and add the pear juice.
6. Mix well and put the broth back in the fridge or freezer until the noodles are ready.

### 3. Prepare noodles
1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the noodles and stir with a wooden spoon. Cover and let them cook for 3 to 5 minutes.
2. Take a sample to taste. When you chew the noodles, there shouldn’t be any hard stuff inside. Be sure not to overcook them or they’ll go soggy.
3. Strain and rinse the noodles in cold running water until they aren’t slippery any more and are well cooled.
4. Fill a large bowl with cold water and some ice cubes. Add the noodles and rinse them a final time.
5. Drain the noodles and divide them into 2 large shallow bowls.

### 4. Put it together
1. Pour the icy broth into each bowl.
2. Place the cucumber and pear on top.
3. Add a packet of mustard oil to each bowl.
4. Sprinkle with some sesame seeds powder. Add a half egg on top of each bowl.
5. Serve right away.
