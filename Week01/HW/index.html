  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Mul Naengmyeon is a Korean cold noodle dish made with thin, chewy buckwheat noodles served in a refreshing, icy
    broth. It's a perfect dish for a hot summer day, offering a delightful combination of savory, tangy, and slightly
    sweet flavors. The dish is typically garnished with sliced beef, pickled radish, cucumber, and a hard-boiled egg,
    adding a variety of textures and tastes to each bite.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>10 ounces (280 grams) dried naengmyeon noodles</li>
    <li>2 packets of liquid or powdered concentrated broth that comes with the package of naengmyeon noodles</li>
    <li>2 packets of mustard oil that comes with the package of naengmyeon noodles.</li>
    <li>½ English cucumber, cut into thin strips</li>
    <li>1 Korean pear (or 2 bosc pears)</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
    <li>1½ teaspoon sugar</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon white or apple cider vinegar</li>
    <li>1 hard-boiled egg, cut in halves</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds, ground</li>
    <li>ice cubes</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Instructions (Serves 2 people)</h2>
  <h3>1. Make Broth</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Open the packets of the concentrated broth and put them into a bowl. Mix with 4 cups of water.</li>
    <li>Keep in the freezer for 4 to 5 hours so it gets slushy.</li>
    <li>If you can’t make the broth in advance, make the broth with only 2 cups of water and add 2½ cups of ice cubes.
      Keep it in the fridge while you prepare everything else, and take it out just when you’re ready to serve.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>2. Prepare cucumber and pear garnishes</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Make quick pickled cucumbers by combining the sliced cucumber, kosher salt, ½ teaspoon sugar, and vinegar in a
      bowl. Mix it well and set aside.</li>
    <li>Make sugar water by mixing 1 cup of water and 1 teaspoon sugar.</li>
    <li>Peel the pear and slice into halves. Slice one half into thin strips and soak them in the sugar water to keep
      them from going brown.</li>
    <li>Grate the other half of the pear and squeeze out the juice using a cotton cloth or cheesecloth. You should get
      about ½ cup of pear juice. If you use small bosc pears, use one for garnish and the other for pear juice.</li>
    <li>Take the bowl of broth out of the freezer. Squeeze some cucumber brine into the broth and add the pear juice.
    </li>
    <li>Mix well and put the broth back in the fridge or freezer until the noodles are ready.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>3. Prepare noodles</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the noodles and stir with a wooden spoon. Cover and let them cook for
      3 to 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Take a sample to taste. When you chew the noodles, there shouldn’t be any hard stuff inside. Be sure not to
      overcook them or they’ll go soggy.</li>
    <li>Strain and rinse the noodles in cold running water until they aren’t slippery any more and are well cooled.</li>
    <li>Fill a large bowl with cold water and some ice cubes. Add the noodles and rinse them a final time.</li>
    <li>Drain the noodles and divide them into 2 large shallow bowls.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>4. Put it together</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Pour the icy broth into each bowl.</li>
    <li>Place the cucumber and pear on top.</li>
    <li>Add a packet of mustard oil to each bowl.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle with some sesame seeds powder. Add a half egg on top of each bowl.</li>
    <li>Serve right away.</li>
  </ol>
